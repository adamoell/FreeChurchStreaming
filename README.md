# Free Church Streaming
We are developing free and low-cost hardware and software solutions to facilitate
quality and cost-effective live streaming for churches. Free Church Streaming is
about:

* hardware and software which is purpose-built for church streaming requirements
* good stewardship: far more cost effective than commercial options
* kingdom minded: as churches contribute to the improvement of the Free Church
Streaming systems, they improve their own capabilities - and also bless all the
other churches using the system.

## Hardware
Our aim is to provide a range of open-source hardware which can be made using
3D printers and inexpensive commodity electronics. So far we have designs for 
the following items:

* Cameras
* Camera Wall Mounts
* Lighting
* Lighting Control
* OBS Foot Pedal

## Software
As well as the firmware for the hardware projects, we provide the following
software systems:

* Camera Control System
* Lighting Control System
* Church Access Control System
